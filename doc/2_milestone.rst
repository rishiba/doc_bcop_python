Description

`print()` is a function in Python language to print some data on the screen
For now, the following ways of using the `print()` function is enough.
Print is useful for user interaction. Whenever you want some message to be displayed on the monitor you can use `print()` function.

::

  print("hello world")

  print("hi friend")

  print("sum is: ", 10)

  # Printing a variable

  x = 10
  print("x is ", 10)

  # Printing another variable

  y = 10

  print("variable is ", y)

**Variables**


Variables are just like `x` in your algebra. This `x` can store any value in algebra. Similarly we can store any value in a variable.

Whenever we talk about a varaible in a programming language like C, C++, Java - we have an a associated data type. In Python the concept of datatype is very loose and is not required while defining a variable. Hence we have chosen the Python as a language to learn programming.



Operators
=========


Operators are very simple. There are various types of operators

Maths/Arithmatic operators are  `+`,  `-`,  `*`,  `/`, `%` - namely "addition", "substration", "multiplication", "division", "modulus"

Modulus or `%` - might be new to you. This operator gives the remainer of a divison

Then there are Comparison Operators  == != < > <= >=. These are used to check if two numbers are

#.  `==` -- `equal`
#. `!=` -- `not equal to`
#.  `<` -- less than
#.  `>` -- greater than
#.  `<=` -- `less than or equal to`
#.  `>=` -- greater than or equal to`

This operators are useful in decison making.




Now, let us see some examples.

#. **Do not proceed to the next question unless you are able to solve the first question.**

   #.  This is very important. Remember that you will face difficulties. That is the core of learning something new. People who cross those difficulties gain something or learn something. People who skip those difficulties, do not learn those concepts.

   #. We are here to learn. Skipping will not help in any manner

#. **Do not copy the solution from others.**

   #. Keep working on finding the solution yourself.
   #. If required, discuss it with people, go through the videos and content multiple times, or read books, watch youtube videos. But do not COPY the solution.
   #. Remember no one is watching you - and no-ones life will be effected if you copy it from anywhere. You are doing it for yourself.

Here are some questions on what you have learnt so far. The questions have all the required information for solving them.

#.  Add 5 and 6 and save its value in a variable. Print this value with the message `Sum of 5 and 6 is`
#.  Multiply 5 and 6 and save its value in a variable. Print this value with the message `Product of 5 and 6 is`
#.  Divide 6 by 5 and save the value in a variable. Print this value with the message `Quotient of the divison 6/5 is`.
#.  Find the remainder when 6 is divided by 5. Save this in a variable. Print this with appropriate message.
#.  Take two number as input from the user and then add them. Print with appropriate message.
#.  Create two variables. In one variable save 5 and in another save 6.  Add the variables and print the value.
#.  Add 5 and 6.
#.  Find the product of 200 and 3.
#.  Find the profit. Take two variables `costPrice` and `profitPercentage`. Using it find the `profit`. # Solved in course
#.  Add two numbers.
#.  Add 1 to all the digits of a 5 digit number. Take a 5 digit number in a variable and then add 1 to all the digits in the number. For example if you will add 1 to `12345` it will become `23456`. If you do the same thing to `99999` it will become `100000`. *# Solved in course*
#.  Find the circumference of a circle. Take a variable named as `radius`. Print the circumference of the circle.
#.  Convert Kms to Meters. Take a variable named `kiloMeters`. Print the value of it in `meters`
#.  Convert KMs to Millimeters. Take a variable named `kiloMeters`. Print the value of it in `MilliMeters`
#.  Convert KMs to feet.
#.  Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
#.  Sum of the digits of a 5 digit number. Take a 5 digit number, now sum all the digits of that number. For example `12345` - now add all the digits - answer is `15`
#.  Average of digits for a 5 digit number. Example `12345` - average is `3`
#.  Find the volume of a cube.
#.  Calculate the amount after adding the simple interest.
#.  Make number from 5 digits. Take 5 variables. `var1`, `var2`, `var3`, `var4`, `var5` - now make a number from it. For example if `var1` = 1, `var2` = 2, `var3` = 3, `var4` = 4, `var5` = 5. Then the number will be `12345`. Hint: a number is made by multiplying the digit to the digit place. For example `12345` =  `1` * 10000 + `2` * 1000 ... and so on.
#.  Product of digits of a 5 digit number.
#.  Rotate by 3 places for a 5 digit number.
#.  Reverse a 5 digit integer.
